# teach-yourself-machine-learning

----------


Ok! Being a back end software developer is of course the bread & butter for me , but now the impact of machine learning is evident and good time to spend atleast a good chunk of time refreshing the stuffs I have heard or know with practical snippets.

Mostly I will follow youtube series and the blog posts and/or (little book reading)

I am following this two guys lecture or information blos on youtube:

- Basics of Linear Algebra (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&t=49s&index=1&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
- Linear Algebra (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iGzBMboA0I&index=1&list=PLtmWHNX-gukIc92m1K0P6bIOnZb-mg0hY&t=84s)
- Math of Intelligence (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mu0bSksCGMJEmeddU_H4D)
